We're using MVC pattern in the assignment:  
- ImageView class is about showing views to the user. ImageUtil class and ImageController class are those handling user input. 
- ImageService class is much like the service layer in Spring MVC and it helps to operate on the models when the task is too complicated to be written all in controllers. 
- Finally, we have model classes like RGBPixel and MyImage, representing RGB pixels and 8 bit RGB images. 

The package structure is as follows:


Other interfaces and design purpose is further explained down below.

## Interface

### Pixel

#### Purpose
This interface is used to describe pixels. All pixels use a map to store the channelsMap it has and the values in the corresponding channel.

#### Methods

- public boolean containsChannel(Channel channel)
    - Check if the pixel contains the given channel.

- public abstract Pixel linearTransformation(float[][] matrix) throws IllegalArgumentException;
    - Performs linear transformation on the pixel valus. For example, for an RGB matrix, that is calculate 3x3 matrix * 3*1 [r,g,b].

- public abstract Pixel addition(float[] matrix) throws IllegalArgumentException;
    - Adds matrix to pixel. E.g. calculate pixel[r',g',b'] = matrix[x,y,z] + pixel[r,g,b].
- public abstract Pixel addition(Pixel pixel) throws IllegalArgumentException;
    - Adds two pixels. E.g. calculate [r,g,b] + [r',g',b'] for two RGB pixels.

- abstract Pixel getChannelComponent(Channel channel);
    - Get certain channel component of the pixel, which means the result pixel has same value as the original one on the given channel, but with 0 on the other channelsMap.

- public abstract Pixel max();
    - Calculate the max value among all channelsMap of the pixel and get a pixel with all channelsMap this value.

- public abstract Pixel avg();
    - Calculate the average value among all channelsMap of the pixel and get a pixel with all channelsMap this value.
- public boolean isGreyscale()
    - Check if this pixel is greyscale by checking if each channel has the same value. The default implementation traverse all values in channelsMap to see if they are all same.

- public String toString()
    - Returns a string representation of the pixel by printing out the channelsMap and corresponding values.


### Image

#### Purpose
This interface describes images composed of pixels. It contains commom methods across all kind of images, like multiplying matrix to every pixel, adding value to pixels, etc.

The key design here is to categorize image operations according to the mechanisms of the operations.  While image class presents methods to realize the calculations described in the category column, the operations in the service class make use of them and bring more operations.

| Operation    | Category |
| -------- | ------- |
| get single channel image  | matrix multiplication (on pixel, 3x3 matrix with 3x1 rgb)   |
| value | matrix multiplication     |
| luma    | matrix multiplication    |
| intensity    | matrix multiplication    |
| greyscale    | matrix multiplication    |
| flip    | affine transformation (project coordinates according to matrix and move pixel at (x,y) to the projected position (x',y'))    |
| brighten    | pixel addition (adding values to channelsMap)    |
| darken    | pixel addition    |
| combine   | pixel addition    |
| blur   | filtering (on the whole image)    |
| sharpen   | filtering    |
| sepia   | matrix multiplication    |

### ImageView

#### Purpose
This class is responsible delivering views and communicating with the user by displaying messages. 

#### Methods
- `public ImageView(Reader reader, Appendable output) ` 
    - Initializes an image viewer which reads information from the specified input and displays messages to a designated output.
- `public String getUserCommand()`  
    - Fetches a command entered by the user from the input source.
- `public void displayMessage(String message)`  
    - Shows the provided message on the screen.
- `public int getModeChoice()`  
    - Retrieves the mode selected by the user, which should be a number.
- `public String getFilePath()`  
    - Prompts the user for a file path and reads it from the input source.

### ImageUtil

#### Purpose
This class provide the main entry point for the program and initializes the other components like controller ans service classes.

#### Methods
- `public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException ` 
    - This is the starting point for the image application. It sets up the necessary components for the program: the service for images, the view to interact with the user, and the controller that links them. It asks the user to choose how they want to input commands: directly through the console or from a file.

### ImageController

#### Purpose
This class deals with user's input commands or on the command-file and inteprets the order to execute corresponding operations on the specific image.

#### Methods
- `public ImageController(ImageService imageService, ImageView imageView) ` 
    - Sets up a controller that connects the image service (which handles image operations) with the view (which interacts with the user).
- `public void start()`  
    - Begins an interaction loop with the user, where the user is continuously prompted to enter commands. These commands are then executed to perform operations on images. If the command starts with "#", it's seen as a comment and ignored. The interaction continues until the user enters the "exit" command.
- `public void startFromFile(String filePath) throws IOException`  
    - Starts processing commands from a provided file. Each line in the file is treated as a command which gets executed one after the other. Similar to the direct interaction, commands starting with "#" are considered comments and thus ignored. If the file contains the "exit" command, the processing stops.
- `public void executeCommand(String command)`  
    - Processes and executes commands related to image operations. It first parses the provided command, then performs the specified image operation based on the command's name. The results or status messages are displayed to the user via the imageView. In the event of an invalid command or if a referenced image is not found, error messages are displayed.
  
  
## Change Notes For Assignment 5:
- Adding Compressor interface and HaarWaveletCompressor class for the compress functionality.
- Change Pixel and Image abstract class to interface. Followed by related necessary modifications like moving some methods implementations to the concrete class.
    - I've actually tried both and struggled with my final decision in Assignment 4. Originally I chose abstract class over interface because 1. The situation is an "is-a" relationship 2. Some common methods can be extracted and the method body can be put in the abstract class for max code reuse.
    - However, these common methods require accessing fields. This prevents me from making the fields all private (because concrete subclass needs to access them. I went for package-private and setting packages because it is stricter in Java than protected and the closest I can get to a C++ protected which seems more "protected".) and all final (similarly, concrete class needs to access them. There're some type-specefic initializations that can't all be put in the abstract class).
    - After last code walk, I try to rethink and balance this visibility issue with code reuse and decided that I will choose a more strict visibility policy. I understand that there's not the absolute perfect design and try to follow the TA's advice of making final fields.
- As a result of making the fields static, loadPPM and loadPNGJPG had to be removed and all image read-in logic has to be put in the constructor.
- Add split and combineImages methods in Image interface and MyImage class. They split and image into two, and combine two images back together, respectively. 
- Modify previous methods that now require performing operations on split views. Add percentage and axis in the arguments and achieve the new functionality by spliting the image first, perform operation on the first part, and combine them back together.
- Add new methods for the histogram, color correct, and level adjustment functionalities. For better layering architecture, I still make separate functions in ImageService and MyImage/Image even if some of them is just calling the function in the bottom layer.
    - Including private tool methods like getFrequency, getMax, findIndexOf in MyImage, and direct methods like getHistogram, colorCorrect and levelAdjustment in MyImage.
    - Methods like getHistogram, colorCorrect and levelAdjustment in ImageService that made use of methods of the same name in MyImage/Image.
- Add four cases to the executeCommand() method in ImageController. These four cases respectively correspond to the 4 newly added commands that can be implemented by the program: compress, histogram, color-correct and levels-adjust.
- Modify the previous logic for parsing blur, sharpen and sepia commands in the ImageController's executeCommand function so that it can correctly parse the value of split percentage and axis.
- Modify the main function in ImageUtil so that it parses the command line arguments and performs different actions based on those arguments. 
    - If the first argument is "-file" followed by the file name, the program will enter script file execution mode.
    - If without any command line arguments, the program interacts with the user at the console as before to get the script commands entered by the user.
- Add a correct JAR file in the res/folder and edit the jar file's configuration (add program argument: -file res/scriptJar.txt). When user run the jar file in res/folder, the program will directly start to parse the commands inside of scriptJar.txt file in res/folder. 
- Edit the ImageUtil.class's configuration as well (add program argument: -file res/scriptJar.txt) so that when user run the ImageUtil.class, the program will directly parse the command in scriptJar.txt file. If user want to input their command or another file path, they need to edit the configuration and delete the program argument. 
- Also, the user can enter the "java -jar CS5010_Assignment4.jar -file scriptTerminal.txt" in terminal to transfer the file to program.("CS5010_Assignment4.jar" is our jar file's name.)
