# Decor Sense

![Decor Sense Logo](app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

Decor Sense is an Android application built using ARCore, Sceneform, and Firebase. It is designed to detect the user's environment, send dimension updates, provide useful product suggestions, and allow users to visualize and try out decor items in an augmented reality (AR) environment. Additionally, the app manages user information, product data, and authentication through Firebase.

## Features

- **Environment Detection:** Decor Sense uses ARCore to detect the user's environment and place virtual decor items realistically.

- **Product Suggestions:** The app provides curated product suggestions based on the user's preferences and space dimensions.

- **AR Visualization:** Users can try out different decor items in their AR environment to visualize how they would look in their space.

- **User Data Management:** Decor Sense securely stores user information and preferences.

- **Authentication:** Firebase authentication is used to manage user sessions and login details.
